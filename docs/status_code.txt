200 — OK ✔️ 💯
Ok. The request went fine and the content requested was returned. This is normally used on GET requests

201 — Created 🐾
The resource was created and the server has acknowledged it. It could be useful on responses to POST or PUT requests. Additionally, the new resource could be returned as part of the response body.

204 — No Content 👌
The action was successful but there is no content returned. Useful for actions that do not require a response body, such as a DELETE action.

301 — Moved Permanently 🏃
This resource was moved to another location and the location is returned. This header is especially useful when URLs change over time (maybe due to a change in version, a migration, or some other disruptive change), keeping the old ones and returning a redirection to the new location allows old clients to update their references in their own time.

308 - (Permanent Redirect)
This status code indicates that the target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed URIs.

400 — Bad Request 👎
The request issued has problems (for example, might be lacking some required parameters). A good addition to a 400 response might be an error message that a developer can use to fix the request.

401 — Unauthorized 🚫 ✖️
Especially useful for authentication when the requested resource is not accessible to the user owning the request

403 — Forbidden ✖️ ⛔️
The resource is not accessible, but unlike 401, authentication will not affect the response.

404 — Not Found 🔍 🔎 🔦
The URL provided does not identify any resource. A good addition to this response could be a set of valid URLs that the client can use to get back on track (root URL, previous URL used, etc.).

405 — Method Not Allowed ✖️
The HTTP verb(e.g POST, GET, PUT etc)used on a resource is not allowed — for instance, doing a PUT on a resource that is read-only.

500 — Internal Server Error 🙈
A generic error code when an unexpected condition is met and the server crashes. Normally, this response is accompanied by an error message explaining what went wrong.
